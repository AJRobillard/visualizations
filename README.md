# Visualizations

This is a repo for introducing data visualization in R.  The code in the repo is focused the ggplot2 library for plots.

You can find a cheatsheet describing the various functions [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)

The RStudio web sites also offer details and examples.
